# IOTFinalProject
This project is a simple implimentation of BLE scanning using Node.js, Express, Mongodb Atlas and Chart.js. To run the start file its simple just downgrade to
Node version 8.9.0. Then either run "sudo node app.js" or "sudo npm start". The start up acounts you can use are room1@dibris.com, room2@dibris.com, room3@dibris.com, room5@dibris.com.
rooms to upto room10@dibris.com, or you can create your own. Then there is an admin account which is called admin@gmail.com. The passwords for all accounts are "mercyme21". 

After you log in an account make sure you stop the scanner once done and also logout. Then stop the server, restart it again to log into a new room or account. When
you log in with the data of the old server while still in the system the new log in will not operate well, so have to stop the server and restart it again every after scan in account. This part of the prototype has not been fixed yet. Otherwise apart from this small hiccup everything works great.

The application has shown better performance in mozilla firefox, though it can also operate in google chrome. I will reccommend that you use mozilla firefox.
